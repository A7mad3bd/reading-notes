In the relational database model, the data structures -- including data tables, indexes and views -- remain separate from the physical storage structures, enabling database administrators to edit the physical data storage without affecting the logical data structure.

In the enterprise, relational databases are used to organize data and identify relationships between key data points. They make it easy to sort and find information, which helps organizations make business decisions more efficiently and minimize costs. They work well with structured data.

Basic SQL
Tables - for those familiar with Excel
SELECT
SELECT 42;

 return  string.
SELECT 5 * 12;

ORDER BY

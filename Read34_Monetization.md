# Publish your app 

## Preparing your app for release
- Preparing your application for release is a multi-step process that involves the following tasks:

 - If you plan to publish on Google Play, you should also read the Google Play launch checklist. 

- You have to configure several other settings to meet Google Play requirements or accommodate whatever method you're using to release your application.


## Building and signing a release version of your application.
- You can use the Gradle build files with the release build type to build and sign a release version of your application. See Building and Running from Android Studio.

- Releasing your app to users
- You can release your Android applications several ways. Usually, you release applications through an application marketplace such as Google Play.

Releasing your application on Google Play is a simple process that involves three basic steps:

Preparing promotional materials.

Configuring options and uploading assets.


- Publishing the release version of your application.


## Releasing through a website
- As APK file on your website and provide a download link to users.


-  Although it is relatively easy to release your application on your own
 - website, it can be inefficient. For example, if you want to monetize your application you will have to process and track all financial transactions yourself and you will not be able to use Google Play's In-app Billing service to sell in-app products. In addition, you will not be able to use the Licensing service to help prevent unauthorized installation and use of your application.

## Install unknown apps
- On devices running Android 8.0 (API level 26) and higher, users must grant permission to install apps from a source that isn't a first-party app store. To do so, they must enable the Allow app installs setting for that source within the Install unknown apps system settings screen. Figure 1 illustrates this process.

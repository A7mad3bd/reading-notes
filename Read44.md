### Self-Driving Car Ethics

- This is a huge discussion in the tech world currently. How will self driving cars impact the world? More specifically, how will the algorithms that these vehicles use respond in given situations. Its aparent to me that this is an inevitable introduction into our society, and we really have to start questioning how these innovations integrate and impact our world rather than simply focusing on how to build them.


- Self-driving cars could save tens of thousands of lives each year, Shariff said. But individual fears could slow down acceptance, leaving traditional cars and their human drivers on the road longer to battle it out with autonomous or semi-autonomous cars

- within a few years, there will be tens of thousands of semi-autonomous vehicles on the roads.

- Self-driving vehicles will ease commutes, return lost time to workers; enhances mobility for seniors and those with physical challenges, and sharply reduce the more than 35,000 death on U.S> highways each year.

-I agree with this article that Self-driving cars will be a good change.


## Ethics in the workplace

### Google and Ai
- Google will work with the US Military on cybersecurity, search and rescue, and other non-offensive projects.

- Google is committed to not using AI for weapons or surveillance after employees protested the company's involvement in Project Maven, a Pentagon pilot program that uses AI to analyze drone footage.

-   Google denied working on these programs, then getting caught with their hand in the cookie jar is enough for anyone to question their motives behind some of these projects.

-I am not sure about the google rule and the purpose of this work.

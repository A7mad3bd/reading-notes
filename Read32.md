# Serverless
- Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider. Pricing is based on the number of executions rather than pre-purchased compute capacity, isnâ€™t it the ideal framework for that project you have been planning since a long time? Well, go ahead do it.

- Serverless applications are event-driven cloud-based systems where application development rely solely on a combination of third-party services, client-side logic and cloud-hosted remote procedure calls (Functions as a Service).

Pricing
One of the major advantages of using Serverless is reduced cost, for years the cost of provisioning servers and maintaining that 24x7 server team which blew a hole in your pocket is gone. with a peak execution time of 300-second for most Cloud vendors.

Networking
The downside is that Serverless functions are accessed only as private APIs

## Frameworks
Serverless Framework (Javascript, Python, Golang)
Apex (Javascript)
ClaudiaJS (Javascript)
Sparta (Golang)
Gordon (Javascript)
Zappa (Python)
Up (Javascript, Python, Golang, Crystal)

AWS Amplify
AWS Amplify is a set of purpose-built tools and features that lets front-end web and mobile developers quickly and easily build full-stack applications on AWS, with the flexibility to leverage the breadth of AWS services as your use cases evolve.

API (GraphQL), Data Modeling
Setup database tables
@model will create a database table, and automatically add an id field as a primary key to the database table(you can override it by @primaryKey), also adds the helper fields createdAt and updatedAt to your type.

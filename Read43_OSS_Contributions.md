### First Timers
- Try to find a project or an issue to solve to contribute to OSS
- Understand the workflow in GitHub
- You can use code Triage to get a notification on projects that you follow that have issues
- Basically go out there and fins something to contribute

###  GitHub

- GitHub hosts millions of open source projects so you can contribute to the community and develop your skills abd GitHub has guides to walk you through the open source processand If you find a bug contribute to fix yourself to develop your skills and you can connect with people who interested in working on the same things as you and work with more experienced people


###  Improve coding skills

###  Gain Early Experience

- another motivation is that OSS provides new devs with useful and valuable experience often required by companies for employment, even internships and entry-level positions.
- allows for young devs to get better at reading code produces by other, finding and fixing bugs, and adding their code into the main repository.
- can help secure a position and move you into full-time work and accelerate your career.

###  Increase Community and Peer Recognition

- encourages and motivates a dev to improve his/her skills and create a number of opportunities, such as job offers and invitations to attend conferences and events.

###  Greater Job Prospects

- can improve your job and career prospects.
- tech companies will spend more time looking at your Github account.
- OSS is visible to the public so potential employers can inspect your code and assess your skills as a developer based on the code your written.
- other benefits include consulting and freelance work

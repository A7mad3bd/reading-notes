# General code design principles:


## DRY - > (Don't repeat yourself) is a principle for software development that stands for Don't repeat yourself to reduce repetition code software patterns, by replacing it to avoid redundancy with abstract or using data normalization.
 

## YAGNI - > (You aren't gonna need it) is a principle that arose from extreme programming that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary


## MVP - > (minimum viable product) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development.


## Rule of three ("Three strikes and you refactor") is a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when similar pieces of code should be refactored to avoid duplication. It states that two instances of similar code do not require refactoring, but when similar code is used three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure. The rule was popularized by Martin Fowler in Refactoring and attributed to Don Roberts.

### OOP
Programing Model organizes software design data rather than functions and logic.
Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods

### Object
 Java object is like member of a Java class. Each object has an identity, a behavior, and a state.

### Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers
Binary in java
A binary literal is a number that is represented in 0s and 1s (binary digits). 

### Decimals in java
In Java, we have two primitive types that represent decimal numbers â€“ float and decimal: double Double = 7.8723d; float Float = 7.8723f; The number of decimal places can be different depending on the operations being performed. 

### Hexadecimal Numbers
Hexadecimal (or "hex" for short) is a numbering system which works similarly to our regular decimal system, but where a single digit can take a value of 0-15 rather than 0-9. The extra 'digits' are the letters A-F, which represent decimal values 10-15.

the reason is that hexadecimal is more "in tune" with how numbers are organised internally when it comes to computer memory and data. The divisions between hexadecimal digits correspond more closely to the divisions between the bytes making up that number when it is stored.
